    intro: 'Before drawing anything, work out how big this is. A few quick numbers decide the design.',
    summary: { title: 'About 12 Tbps to serve, and 35,000 transcoders busy all day.', body: 'Serving is the huge number: no origin carries it, so a CDN must answer nearly every play. Transcoding is the other: it is slow, bursty work, so queue it, cut it into pieces and add machines when the queue grows. And a new video that millions want at once is on no cache yet.' },
    questions: [
      { question: '100 million people watch an hour a day, at 3 Mbps. About how much bandwidth is in use on average?', options: ['About 125 Gbps', 'About 12 Tbps', 'About 1.2 Pbps'], answer: 1, at: 'viewers', show: '12 Tbps', why: 'An hour a day is one in 24 people watching at any moment: about 4 million. 4 million × 3 Mbps is about 12 Tbps. No single origin can send that, so a CDN has to.' },
      { question: 'A million videos are uploaded a day, each 100 MB. About how much new storage a day, before any qualities?', options: ['About 10 TB', 'About 100 TB', 'About 1 PB'], answer: 1, at: 's0', show: '100 TB / day', why: '1 million × 100 MB is 100 TB. The qualities made from each add about twice that again, so around 300 TB a day, over 100 PB a year.' },
      { question: 'Each video is 10 minutes and takes about 10 minutes to transcode in each of 5 qualities. About how many transcoders are busy all day?', options: ['About 350', 'About 3,500', 'About 35,000'], answer: 2, at: 'enc-0', show: '35,000 transcoders', why: '1 million × 5 × 10 minutes is 50 million minutes of work a day. A day has 1,440 minutes, so about 35,000 transcoders. Autoscaling keeps them busy only when there is work.' },
      { question: 'The CDN answers 95 of every 100 plays, from 12 Tbps. About how much still reaches the origin?', options: ['About 60 Gbps', 'About 600 Gbps', 'About 6 Tbps'], answer: 1, at: 'origin', show: '600 Gbps', why: '5% of 12 Tbps is 600 Gbps. Even a good CDN leaves the origin a lot, so every extra point of hit rate matters, and a shared cache in front of the origin helps.' },
      { question: 'A film is two hours long and is cut into segments of 10 seconds. About how many segments?', options: ['About 72', 'About 720', 'About 7,200'], answer: 1, at: 'uploaders', show: '720 segments', why: '7,200 seconds ÷ 10 is 720. Each is a separate task, so 720 transcoders could work on one film at once, and the player downloads them one at a time.' },
