About how many charges are in flight at once, at the peak?', options: ['About 4', 'About 40', 'About 400'], answer: 1, at: 'provider', show: '42 calls in flight', why: '140 orders a second × 0.3 seconds is about 42 calls open at any moment.' },

About how many calls pile up?', options: ['About 140', 'About 1,400', 'About 14,000'], answer: 1, at: 'checkout', show: '1,400 calls waiting', why: '140 a second × 10 seconds is about 1,400 calls. More than checkout can hold, so shoppers are turned away. Give up early, and stop calling.' },
