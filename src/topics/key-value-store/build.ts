    summary: { title: 'About 10 nodes to serve it, and 3 TB to hold it.', body: 'Serving needs several nodes, so keys must be spread by a ring, not kept on one machine. Holding three copies of a TB means the store must also survive losing a node, and copying a node’s data to a new one takes hours, not seconds.' },

      { question: 'The store takes 100,000 operations a second at peak. One node can serve about 10,000. About how many nodes just to serve the traffic?', options: ['About 10', 'About 100', 'About 1,000'], answer: 0, at: 'coord', show: '~10 nodes', why: '100,000 ÷ 10,000 is 10. In practice, add room for peaks and for nodes that are down, so 15 to 20, but not hundreds.' },
      { question: 'There are a billion keys, and every value is 1 KB. About how much data is that?', options: ['About 1 GB', 'About 1 TB', 'About 1 PB'], answer: 1, at: 'n2', show: '1 TB', why: '1 billion × 1 KB is 1,000 GB, which is 1 TB. It fits on one disk, but not on one machine that must also serve 100,000 operations a second.' },
      { question: 'Every key is kept on 3 nodes. About how much storage must be bought?', options: ['About 1 TB', 'About 3 TB', 'About 30 TB'], answer: 1, at: 'n1', show: '3 TB', why: 'Three copies of 1 TB is 3 TB. Copies cost storage, and every write now goes to three nodes, so writes cost three times as much work as reads.' },
      { question: 'A key has 3 copies. A write needs 2 answers. How many of the 3 nodes can be down before writes to that key stop?', options: ['None', 'One', 'Two'], answer: 1, at: 'r1', show: '1 node down', why: 'With 3 copies and a quorum of 2, one node can be down and the other two still answer. If two are down, only one is left, which is below the quorum, so the write is refused.' },
      { question: 'A node holds 1 TB. A new node copies it at 100 MB/s. About how long until the new node has its keys?', options: ['About 3 minutes', 'About 3 hours', 'About 3 days'], answer: 1, at: 'n3', show: '~3 hours', why: '1 TB ÷ 100 MB/s is 10,000 seconds, about 3 hours. Adding a node is not instant. Spread the work over many small slices so each node sends a little, and the copy is far shorter.' },
